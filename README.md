# Kaggle-Movie-Recommendation
# Movie Recommendation Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a movie recommendation project, developed for a Kaggle competition. The goal of this project is to build a robust movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and consists of a large collection of movie ratings given by users. It includes information such as user IDs, movie IDs, and corresponding ratings. The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set, with the training set used for model training and the testing set used for evaluation.

## Approach

The movie recommendation system is built using collaborative filtering techniques, specifically employing the **matrix factorization** method. This approach aims to capture latent factors that influence user preferences and movie characteristics. By decomposing the user-item rating matrix into lower-rank matrices, it becomes possible to estimate missing ratings and make personalized recommendations.

The steps involved in the project include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of ratings, user behavior, and movie characteristics.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming it into a suitable format for training the recommendation model.

3. Matrix Factorization Model: Implementing a matrix factorization algorithm, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS), to learn latent factors and predict movie ratings.

4. Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, training the recommendation model on the training set, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model by optimizing hyperparameters to improve its accuracy and generalization ability.

6. Generating Recommendations: Utilizing the trained model to generate personalized movie recommendations for users based on their historical ratings or preferences.

## Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. Download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page and place it in the appropriate folder within the project structure.

4. Preprocess the dataset using the provided scripts to clean the data and prepare it for model training.

5. Train the recommendation model using the chosen matrix factorization algorithm. You can modify the model hyperparameters as needed.

6. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set and tune the hyperparameters if necessary.

7. Generate movie recommendations for users based on their preferences using the trained model.

## Results

The success of the movie recommendation system will be evaluated based on various metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE), to measure the accuracy of predicted ratings. Additionally, top-K recommendation accuracy metrics, such as precision and recall, can be used to assess the system's ability to suggest relevant movies to users.

## Conclusion

This movie recommendation project aims to leverage collaborative filtering techniques to build an effective and personalized movie recommendation system. By employing matrix factorization algorithms and leveraging user ratings, the system can provide tailored suggestions to users, enhancing their movie-watching experience. The repository contains the necessary code and resources to replicate and extend this project, contributing to the field of recommendation systems.
